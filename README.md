Open the data folder

Open a terminal in the folder and make the file data.sh executable by : chmod 744 data.sh

Execute data.sh with the command line: sh -x ./data.sh

(If executing the .sh file doesn't work, you can directly download the books_withcat.csv, ratings.csv and csr_matrix.npz files and add them to the data folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Ej1Ui2liusJ_32gxcb08jrZkcVQSjp0?usp=sharing)
